INCIDENCE OF CAR CRASH IN THE PHILIPPINES


Problematic Situation
High Incidence of Car Crashes
Undesirable Effects
High rate of fatalities, injuries, and property damage, causing significant loss of life, physical harm, and economic burdens on individuals and society.


1

Conduct of surprise drug testing of
drivers and conductors in major bus,
jeepney and public utility vehicle
(PUV) terminals throughout the
country.

OPLAN HARABAS: simultaneous surprise mandatory drug testing to all
drivers in public terminals nationwide
198 out of 17,396 public transport employees yielded positive for drug use
(2019)
61 out of 4,210 public transport employees yielded positive for drug use
(2022); 20 were tricycle drivers; 10 were jeepney drivers; 11 were bus
drivers; seven were van drivers; seven were tricycle drivers; five were
conductors; and one dispatcher

There are still issues with
compliance or the effectiveness
of deterrence measures
Needs stricter enforcement
mechanisms and imposition of
penalties

2

Restraining the use of electronic mobile devices during driving

CCTVs were strategically placed near traffic lights to catch those who
would use their phones during a stop
92 drivers were caught being distracted by their phones (2017)
33% decrease in road accidents related to distracted driving in the following year (2017)
Captured photos thru Camera
Less use of devices during driving

Limited number of cameras
Drivers already know where are the cameras are
Lack of Enforcement

3

Extending the driver's license validity
period which is based on the violations
of the driver

Stricter rules/procedures prior to issuance of driver’s license (i.e. 15 hour
lecture, practical test)
Medical tests are only required during application and renewal of driver’s
license
5,121,656 (2022) vs. 5,583,401 (2023) driver’s licenses & permits issued;
9.02 % increase

Fixers are prevented
Shortage of license cards
Expensive driving
schools/institutions
Long duration for driving
courses


Assessment of Existing Policies
1
RA 4136
Land
Transportation
and Traffic
Code
(1964)

CHAPTER I, ARTICLE III, SEC 4: Creation of Land Transportation Commission
CHAPTER II, ARTICLE I: All motor vehicles must be properly registered before 
they can be used or operated on public highways.
CHAPTER III, ARTICLE I: All drivers must obtain a license before 
operating a motor vehicle.
CHAPTER IV, ARTICLE I: The law sets speed limits for different types 
of vehicles and requires drivers to keep to the right side of the highway.
CHAPTER V, ARTICLE I: The law imposes penalties for violations, 
including fines, suspension or revocation of driver's licenses, and
confiscation of licenses and number plates

From 2017 to 2023, the number of registered cars in the Philippines 
showed a general upward trend, starting at 1.04 million in 2017 and 
peaking at 1.31 million in 2022.
The registrations increased steadily through 2018 (1.10M), 2019 (1.16M), 
and 2021 (1.22M), with a slight dip in 2020 to 1.13M, likely due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
The estimated figure for 2023 is 1.18M, indicating a decrease from the
previous year's peak. 
Overall, the data reflects a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in 
car registrations over the seven-year period.
Based on the Land Transportation Office running tally, 13 million is the 
number, as of May 31, 2019. Of that number, 7.3 million hold professional 
driver’s licenses, while the rest, or 5.7 million, hold a non-professional 
license.


RA 4136 has effectively increased the 
number of registered cars in the
Philippines, ensuring regulated vehicle
registration and driver compliance.
The law is efficient in its systematic
approach to vehicle registration and
driver licensing, managing a large
number of registrations and
licenses.

2
RA 10054
Motorcycle
Helmet Act
(2009)

SEC 3: All motorcycle riders, including drivers and back riders, 
must wear standard protective motorcycle helmets at all times 
while driving. Standard protective motorcycle helmets are
those that comply with the specifications issued by the 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
SEC 5: Every seller and/or dealer must make available a 
new motorcycle helmet that bears the Philippine Standard 
(PS) mark or Import Commodity Clearance (ICC) of the Bureau of
Product Standards (BPS) and complies with the standards 
set by the BPS.

In 2023, motorcycles were involved in 22.03% of road accidents in
Metro Manila, making them the second most common vehicle type in
accidents after cars. This highlights the need for increased safety 
measures for motorcycle riders.

While the law may be effective 
in reducing the severity of 
injuries in accidents, it has 
not significantly reduced
the incidence of motorcycle
accidents.

3
RA 8750
Seat Belts Use
Act (1999)

SEC 4: The driver and front seat passengers of
both public and private motor vehicles must
wear seat belt devices while the vehicle is
running on any road or thoroughfare.
SEC 5: Infants and children below six years old
are not allowed to sit in the front seat of a
running motor vehicle.
SEC 7: New motor vehicles cannot be initially
registered or renewed unless they are equipped
with the necessary seat belt devices.

The Land Transportation Office (LTO) has apprehended
529,578 motorists in 2023. LTO chief said some of the
most common violations were on the Clean Air Act or 
the Republic Act (RA) 8749, Seatbelt Law Act or RA 
8750 and overloading. A total of 23,614 motor vehicles 
were also impounded by the LTO last year, an increase 
of 47 percent compared to 2022.

There are active efforts to 
uphold the law, however the
persistent number of violators 
indicates lack of resources
such as manpower and logistics 
to fully implement the policy.

4
RA 10586
Anti-Drunk
and Drugged
Driving Act
(2013)

SEC. 2: State policy aims to ensure road safety
through responsible driving standards,
penalizing driving under influence, and
promoting safe driving through programs and
information strategies.
SEC. 4: All driver's license applicants must
undergo safe driving education covering
alcohol/drug effects and penalties. Professional
drivers require this education too, with exams
including related questions.
SEC. 6: Law enforcement officers conduct field
sobriety tests on suspected intoxicated drivers,
followed by blood alcohol concentration tests if
failed. Suspected drug use leads to drug
screening and confirmatory tests. Enforcement
falls on officers and deputized traffic personnel.
SEC. 7: Drivers involved in accidents causing
injury or death must undergo alcohol and
chemical testing to determine substance
presence, as per Republic Act No. 9165.

There were a total of 296,760/894,989 (31%)
patients admitted due to transport and 
vehicular crash (TVC) based on the 10-year 
data from ONEISS (2010–2019). There was an 
increasing trend in the number of transport/ 
vehicular crashes (TVC) during this period, 
with an average increase of 25.58% cases per
year. The highest reported contributing factor 
was drunk driving (n = 25,537). Road accidents 
caused by drunk drivers increased by at least 
90 percent in November, which prompted the 
Philippine National Police (PNP) to launch 
an intensified drive against drunk driving 
(December 2022).

Contributed to the reduction
of number of accidents however, 
enforcement varies in different 
regions.
Law provides penalties/apprehension, 
however resources and capacity may be 
limited or inadequate which can affect 
the execution of the law.

5
RA 10913
Anti-
Distracted
Driving Act
(2015)

SEC 2: The state declares its policy to protect
citizens from the harmful effects of vehicular
accidents and acknowledges the dangers of using
electronic mobile devices while driving, leading to
regulation.
SEC 4: Distracted driving encompasses using
mobile devices for texting or calls, and using
electronic entertainment or computing devices
while driving, whether the vehicle is in motion or
temporarily stopped at a red light.
SEC 5: Coverage includes exceptions for
hands-free device use, specifies covered vehicles
and circumstances, and exempts stationary
vehicles except those temporarily stopped at a red
light or pulled over in compliance with traffic
regulation.
SEC6: Exemptions apply to emergency phone use
and operation of mobile phones

A total of 1,290 incidents recorded from 2012 
to 2014 were caused by drivers using their 
mobile phones.

Policy aims to address the
growing problem of distracted 
driving which reduces accidents 
however there’s still a concern 
on the lack of enforcement and
public compliance.
Lack of equipment

Policy Problem
The existing policies designed to protect road users have become
inadequate and outdated.
